# Scheduled Phone Call Reminder System

A Next.js application that enables users to schedule automated phone call reminders with retry attempts, backup contact escalation, and real-time status tracking.

## Project Milestones

### âœ… Milestone 1 (M1) - Data Layer & CRUD Operations
**Status: Complete**

Implemented the foundational data layer with PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM, including:
- **Database Schema:**
  - `reminders` table with fields for scheduling, phone numbers, retry attempts, and status tracking
  - `call_logs` table for recording call history and outcomes
  - Status enum: SCHEDULED, CALLING, RETRYING, DONE, ESCALATED
- **REST API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/reminders` - Create reminders with E.164 phone validation
  - `GET /api/reminders` - List all reminders sorted by newest first
- **Default Values:** Automatically sets status="SCHEDULED", attempts=0, next_attempt_at=scheduled_at

### âœ… Milestone 2 (M2) - Web Dashboard
**Status: Complete**

Built a comprehensive web dashboard for managing phone call reminders:
- **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`):**
  - Form to create new reminders with title, primary/backup phones, and scheduled time
  - Real-time table displaying all reminders with auto-refresh every 5 seconds
  - Color-coded status badges: ðŸŸ¢ DONE, ðŸŸ¡ CALLING, ðŸ”´ ESCALATED, ðŸ”µ SCHEDULED, ðŸŸ  RETRYING
  - "Call Now" button for immediate call triggering
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/call-now` - Reset reminder to trigger immediate call
  - `POST /api/scheduler/tick` - Process due reminders (stub implementation)
- **Features:**
  - E.164 phone format validation on both client and server
  - Optimistic UI updates with loading states
  - Clear error messages and user feedback
  - Enhanced text visibility for better user experience

### âœ… Milestone 3 (M3) - Scheduler & Processing Engine
**Status: Complete**

Implemented a robust scheduler for processing phone call reminders with retry and escalation logic:
- **Scheduler Endpoint (`/api/scheduler/tick`):**
  - Finds due reminders (next_attempt_at <= now, status in [SCHEDULED, RETRYING, ESCALATED])
  - Atomically updates to CALLING status using Prisma transactions (prevents race conditions)
  - Creates call_log entries with unique mock call_sid for each attempt
  - Simulates call outcomes for testing (70% success rate)
- **Retry Logic:**
  - Primary phone: max 1 attempt with 1-minute retry delay
  - Backup phone: max 1 attempt with 1-minute retry delay
  - Tracks attempts separately (attempts vs backupAttempts fields)
- **Escalation System:**
  - After primary phone failures â†’ ESCALATED status if backup exists
  - After primary phone failures â†’ DONE status if no backup available
  - Processes ESCALATED reminders by calling backup_phone
- **Processing Summary:**
  - Returns detailed counts: processed, successful, retrying, escalated, completed
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Concurrency Safety:**
  - Atomic database operations prevent double-processing
  - Multiple scheduler runs can execute safely in parallel

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
